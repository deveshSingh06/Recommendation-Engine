# Recommendation-Engine
- In this repository, a simple recommendation engine is created using Apple's [Turicreate](https://github.com/apple/turicreate) library.
- The dataset used is created from the [AdventureWorks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/samples/adventureworks-install-configure?view=sql-server-ver15&tabs=ssms) database.
- The recommendation engine is trained on a dataset that includes product ids, customer ids, and the customer name.
